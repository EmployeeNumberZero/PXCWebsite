        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 22nd, 2025</p>

        <p>PXC Inc. ("<strong>PharmacyXChange</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>" or
            "<strong>our</strong>") understands the importance of protecting the personal information of individuals and
            the importance of securing confidential information of all types. We have created this Privacy Policy (this
            "<strong>Policy</strong>") to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Policy explains:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>what personal information we collect and why we collect it;</li>
            <li>how we use your personal information;</li>
            <li>who we share your personal information with; and</li>
            <li>the choices you have to access, update, and remove your personal information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As used in this Policy, "personal information" means any information about an identifiable individual or
            information that can reasonably be used to identify an individual, whether alone or in combination with
            other information. Personal information may include, for example, a person's name, home address, telephone
            number, email address, date of birth, government-issued identification numbers, financial account
            information, payment card details, billing information, location data, and IP address.</p>

        <p>This Policy forms an integral part of, and is subject to, our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. Unless
            otherwise defined in this Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Policy shall have the meanings ascribed
            to them in our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. This Policy sets out the manner in which we may
            collect, use, disclose and other process personal information from users of the Platform
            ("<strong>you</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>"). Personal information may be collected directly from you
            or from third parties who are lawfully permitted to disclose such information to us.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time. Any amendments will be communicated to you either by
            sending a notice to the email address associated with your user account or by posting an updated version of
            the Policy on the Platform. The most recent version of this Policy will govern our collection, use,
            disclosure, retention, and other processing of your personal information. By continuing to access or use the
            Platform following any changes to this Policy, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the revised terms.
            If you do not agree to any amendment, you may cancel your user account at any time. We strongly encourage
            you to review this Policy periodically to remain informed about our practices regarding your personal
            information. The "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this Policy reflects the date of the most recent
            revision.</p>

                retention, and other processing of your personal information as described in this Policy or for the
                purposes communicated to you at the time your information is collected. Any secondary use of your
                personal information will be conducted in accordance with our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>
                (including this Policy), your explicit consent, or as otherwise required by applicable laws.</li>
